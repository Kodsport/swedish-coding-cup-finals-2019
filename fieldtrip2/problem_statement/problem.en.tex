\problemname{Field Trip 2}
There are $N$ students numbered from $1$ to $N$ going on a field trip.
There are $M$ friendships that exist between students.

Students can also be indirectly acquainted with one another.
Two students $i$ and $j$ are acquaintances if they're friends, or if there exists a third student $k$ who is an acquaintance of both students $i$ and $j$.

You're getting ready to order buses for the trip, but there are two issues.
Firstly, the transportation company insists that every bus you order must be filled exactly to its capacity of $K$ students.
They won't allow you to order a bus if you intend to put fewer than $K$ students on it!
Secondly, the students are picky about their travelling conditions.
Each student $i$ will refuse to get on the bus if either of the following conditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All of the other students getting on that bus are acquaintances of student $i$;
  \item All of student $i$'s acquaintances are getting on that bus.
\end{enumerate}

You may choose to sever $0$ or more of the $M$ friendships amongst the students, which will of course also have an affect on which students are acquainted with one another.

Determine the maximum number of students which can be brought on the trip,
such that they're loaded onto buses with exactly $K$ students each, and every student is satisfied with their bus allocation.
Furthermore, since you're feeling generous, determine the minimum number of friendships which you can sever in order to be able to bring that many students along.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$ ($1 \le N$, $0 \le M$, $1 \le K \le N$).

The next $M$ lines contain information about the friendships.
Each of these $M$ lines contain two space-separated integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ ($1 \le i \le M$), meaning that students $A_i$ and $B_i$ are friends ($1 \le A_i, B_i \le N$, $A_i \not= B_i$).
No friendship will be listed twice.

\section*{Input}
Output two integers, the maximum number of students that can be brought along, and the minimum number of friendships you have to sever to bring that many along.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
