\problemname{Mirror, Mirror...}

Mirror, mirror, on the wall, which mirror symmetric subset of these points is the largest of them all?

The set $P$ consists of $N$ points. We say that a subset $S \subseteq P$ is
\emph{mirror symmetric} if there exists a line $\ell$ such that for each point
$p \in S$, the reflection of $p$ across $\ell$ is also in $S$.

Given the set $P$, what is the largest size of any mirror symmetric subset?

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains $N$, the number of points.
The next $N$ lines each consist of two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($-30\,000 \le x_i, y_i \le 30\,000$), the coordinates of each point.

There will be no duplicate points in the input.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer -- the largest size of a mirror symmetric subset.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
